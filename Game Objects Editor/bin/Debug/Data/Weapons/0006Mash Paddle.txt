All-grain brewing requires that the entire grain bill be submerged in the water during the mashing process, as grains that do not get wet won't convert their starches into the sugars, which is essential for the final wort. In order to accomplish this step, you need a Mash Paddle to help you stir the grains in the vessel during the dough-in, or as soon as you add the grains to the water.
